Set PostHog apiKey.

</ResponseExample>

Set your API key by making a `PUT` request to our endpoint. We will start sending analytics on your next site deployment.

<ParamField body="apiKey" type="string" required>
  Your PostHog API key.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="apiHost" type="string" default="https://app.posthog.com">
  Your API host. Keep the default unless you are on a self-hosted instance.
</ParamField>

You can make a `GET` request to verify you set the API key correctly. You can also use a `DELETE` request to remove the integration.
