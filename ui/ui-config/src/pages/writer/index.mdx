{/* Temporary solution for base /writer path */}

Save time and improve your codebase by letting Mintlify generate documentation for you. Install Writer on [VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mintlify.document) or [IntelliJ](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/18606-mintlify-doc-writer).

```python
def get_temp(sorted_temps: list[float], el: float) -> int:
>  """
>  Search through the sorted temperatures array to find the
>  index of the temperature that matches the element
>  :param sorted_temps: sorted list of temperatures
>  :param el: the target element
>  :return: the index of the matched element
>  Author: Richard Hendricks
>  """
  i = 0
  while el != sorted_temps[i] and len(sorted_temps) > i:
    i += 1
  return i if i < len(sorted_temps) else -1;
```
