title: 'Get Job Status'
description: 'Check the generation status and fetch results'
api: 'GET https://api.mintlify.com/docs/worker/{id}'
---

This endpoint checks the status using the `id` from the initialize request endpoint.

**Important**: You must check the status of the job using a time-based listener. Here's an implementation of one using TypeScript that fetches the request every 100 milliseconds

```ts Example of listner in TypeScript
export const monitorJobStatus = async (id: string) => {
  let workerStatus = null;
  const intervalMs = 100;

  while (workerStatus == null) {
    const { data: status } = await axios.get('https://api.mintlify.com/docs/worker/{id}');
    if (status.state === 'completed') {
      workerStatus = status.data;
      break;
    } else if (status.state === 'failed') {
      throw new Error('Unable to generate documentation');
    }

    millisecondsPassed += intervalMs;
    await sleep(intervalMs);
  }

  return workerStatus;
};
```

### Parameters

<ParamField name="id" type="string" required>

The job id after it is initialized

</ParamField>
