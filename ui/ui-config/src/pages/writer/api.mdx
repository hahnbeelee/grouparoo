## Writer API

### Overview

The Writer API lets you programmatically create docstring from codex that you can embed into your application or workflow.

The API works slightly differently than your conventional REST API. Because [Writer](/writer/installation) uses background jobs to generate docstring, its API requires two requests to get the results.

### 1. Initialize Request

The [first request](/writer/initialize-request) initializes a request to begin generating the docstring.

The worker request returns a worker `id` that you can use to track the progress of the docstring generation.

### 2. Get worker status

The [second request](/writer/get-status) checks the progress of the worker using the `id` generated by the previous request.

<TipInfo>
  It is recommended to create a listener to continuously check the result of the
  worker status until the generation request is completed.
