<Tip>

**This is our landing page, product, and documentation.**<br/>
Building world-class documentation doesn't have to be hard. We can't think of a better way to prove that than to do it ourselves.

</Tip>

Mintlify is a documentation platform rendered from Markdown that is [built to convert](#built-to-convert), [simple to work with](#simple-to-work-with), and [blazingly fast](#blazingly-fast).

We make setting up great documentation painless so you can get back to building.

## Introduction

### Built to convert

We sought to build documentation that converts users, and designed everything from the ground up with that in mind.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Navigation" icon={duotone("map")} color="#ea5a0c">
    Tailored to get users to the aha moment
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Search Enabled"
    icon={duotone("magnifying-glass")}
    color="#0285c7"
  >
    Lighting fast and targeted in-app search experience with âŒ˜K
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Insights and Feedback"
    icon={duotone("chart-user")}
    color="#16a34a"
  >
    Understand what matters to your users and let them contribute
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="SEO Optimized"
    icon={duotone("print-magnifying-glass")}
    color="#dc2626"
  >
    High visibility for people searching relevant content
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Simple to work with

We sought to make documentation delightful. Everything, from the interactions to iconography, has been meticulously crafted for better readability and engagement.

Mintlify is opinionated when you're lazy, but infinitely flexible when you need it to be.

<div className="shadow-lg rounded-md border overflow-hidden border-slate-200 dark:border-slate-700">
  <div className="flex-none border-b border-slate-500/10 bg-slate-50 dark:bg-slate-900">
    <div className="flex items-center h-8 space-x-1.5 px-3">
      <div className="w-2.5 h-2.5 bg-red-500 dark:bg-slate-600 rounded-full"></div>
      <div className="w-2.5 h-2.5 bg-yellow-500 dark:bg-slate-600 rounded-full"></div>
      <div className="w-2.5 h-2.5 bg-green-500 dark:bg-slate-600 rounded-full"></div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <img
    className="my-0 hidden dark:block"
    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/mintlify/image/upload/v1659651302/screen-dark_xce9tr.png"
    alt="Dark mode demo"
  />
  <img
    className="my-0 block dark:hidden"

    alt="Light mode demo"
  />
</div>

### Blazingly fast

We believe in the [100ms rule](https://boscutti.com/blogs/journal/100-millisecond-rule). Everything from page loading, interactions, and search is built and optimized to feel instantanous.

<Example>
  <video className="rounded-lg w-full" alt="rocket engine" autoplay loop muted>
    <source src="img/fast.mp4" />
  </video>
</Example>
